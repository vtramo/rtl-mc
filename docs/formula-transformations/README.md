## Discretisation of an RTLf Formula

An RTLf formula undergoes a series of transformations, including:

- **1. Discretisation according to the paper rules**: the RTLf formula is discretised and transformed into an LTLf formula;
- **2. Conversion to an LTL formula**: the resulting LTLf formula is then transformed into an LTL formula.

These transformations can likely be applied in a single pass over the formula tree (using Spot), reducing the number of required steps.

Spot provides a `spot::from_ltlf` function to convert a formula with LTLf semantics into a formula with LTL semantics.

There are two implementations to handle the above transformations:

1. An implementation that performs both discretisation and LTL conversion in one go (does not use `spot::from_ltlf`, but implements the conversion from scratch â€” `--direct-ltl`).
2. An implementation that discretises first, then uses `from_ltlf` to convert to LTL (default).

Both versions have been tested. Version 1 is more performant:
